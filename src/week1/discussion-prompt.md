# Discuss the pros and cons of the two contrasting principles, Kerckhoff's Principle vs. Security by Obscurity.

Kerchoff's principle clearly states that the attacker is just as aware of the system as teh creator
if not more. This forces us to think much more about teh security and integrity of our application.

Using security by obscurity we are lulling ourselves into a false sense of security by just thinking that the attacker will
never discover our secret and only we the programmer or the creator of this application are truly aware of its 
fundamentals and no one else will discover how data is being transferred which is clearly false as a motivated attacker 
will always discover flaws and exploit them as history has clearly shown us before many a time.
